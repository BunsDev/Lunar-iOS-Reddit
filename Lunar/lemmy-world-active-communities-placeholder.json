Questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, song lyrics as title, etc. are not allowed here. See Rule 6 for all exceptions.\n\n**2**-Your question subject cannot be illegal or NSFW material. You will be warned first, banned second.\n\n**3**-Do not seek mental, medical and professional help here. Breaking this rule will not get you or your post removed, but it will put you at risk, and possibly in danger. \n\n**4**-No self promotion or upvote-farming of any kind.\n\n**5**-Questions which, instead of being of an innocuous nature, are specifically intended (based on reports and in the opinion of our crack moderation team) to bait users into ideological wars on charged political topics will be removed and the authors warned - or banned - depending on severity.\n\n**Rule 6**-Provided it is about the community itself, you may post non-question posts using the [META] tag on your post title.\n\nOn fridays, you are allowed to post meme and troll questions, on the condition that it's in text format only, and conforms with our other rules. These posts MUST include the [NSQ Friday] tag in their title.\n\nIf you post a serious question on friday and are looking **only** for legitimate answers, then please include the [Serious] tag on your post. Irrelevant replies will then be removed by moderators. \n\n**7**-If you vocally harass or discriminate against any individual member, you will be removed.\n\nLikewise, if you are a member, sympathiser or a resemblant of a movement that is known to largely hate, mock, discriminate against, and/or want to take lives of a group of people, and you were provably vocal about your hate, then you you will be banned on sight. The first paragraph of this rule does not protect you. \n\n\"Provable\" means able to provide proof to the moderation, and, if necessary, to the community.\n\n**8**-All comments should try to stay relevant to their parent content. \n\n**9**-Reposts from other platforms are not allowed. \n\n**10**-You're not allowed to be an AI(unless you're ours).
