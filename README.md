## Getting Started

Lunar is currently in its alpha testing phase and, as a result, it has not been released on the app store or TestFlight yet. However, you can still install Lunar on your iOS device by following these steps:

1. Ensure you have an Apple developer account. If you don't have one, you can create a free developer account by visiting this link: https://developer.apple.com
   
2. Clone the Lunar repository and open Lunar.xcodeproj.
   
3. In Xcode, select your project, go to the "General" tab, and choose "Automatically manage signing" and your personal team.
   
4. Connect your iPhone to your computer and select it as the run destination.
   
5. Run your project. After a successful build, you might encounter an error in Xcode stating that your app is not from a trustworthy source.
   
6. To resolve this issue, navigate to your device's Settings, search for "Device Management," select your profile name, and then click "Trust."

7. Now, you can run your app again, and it should work without any issues.
